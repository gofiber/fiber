# Client

The Client is used to create a Fiber Client with client-level settings that apply to all requests raise from the client.
Fiber Client also provides an option to override or merge most of the client settings at the request.

It is built top on FastHTTP client.

# TODO: Add more information about gofiber client.

```go
type Client struct {
	mu sync.RWMutex

	fasthttp *fasthttp.Client

	baseURL   string
	userAgent string
	referer   string
	header    *Header
	params    *QueryParam
	cookies   *Cookie
	path      *PathParam

	debug bool

	timeout time.Duration

	// user defined request hooks
	userRequestHooks []RequestHook

	// client package defined request hooks
	builtinRequestHooks []RequestHook

	// user defined response hooks
	userResponseHooks []ResponseHook

	// client package defined response hooks
	builtinResponseHooks []ResponseHook

	jsonMarshal   utils.JSONMarshal
	jsonUnmarshal utils.JSONUnmarshal
	xmlMarshal    utils.XMLMarshal
	xmlUnmarshal  utils.XMLUnmarshal

	cookieJar *CookieJar

	// proxy
	proxyURL string

	// retry
	retryConfig *RetryConfig

	// logger
	logger log.CommonLogger
}
```

## New

New creates and returns a new Client object.

```go title="Signature"
func New() *Client
```

## Request Config

Config for easy to set the request parameters, it should be noted that when setting the request body will use JSON as the default serialization mechanism, while the priority of Body is higher than FormData, and the priority of FormData is higher than File.

It can be used to configurate request data while sending requests using Get, Post etc.

```go
type Config struct {
	Ctx context.Context

	UserAgent string
	Referer   string
	Header    map[string]string
	Param     map[string]string
	Cookie    map[string]string
	PathParam map[string]string

	Timeout      time.Duration
	MaxRedirects int

	Body     any
	FormData map[string]string
	File     []*File
}
```
