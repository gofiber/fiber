## ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to Fiber v3

We are excited to announce the release of Fiber v3! ðŸš€

Fiber v3 is a major release with a lot of new features, improvements, and breaking changes. We have worked hard to make Fiber even faster, more flexible, and easier to use.

## ðŸš€ Highlights

### Drop for old Go versions

Fiber v3 drops support for Go versions below 1.21. We recommend upgrading to Go 1.21 or higher to use Fiber v3.

### App changes

We have made several changes to the Fiber app, including:

* Listen -> unified with config
* app.Config properties moved to listen config
  * DisableStartupMessage
  * EnablePrefork -> previously Prefork
  * EnablePrintRoutes
  * ListenerNetwork -> previously Network

#### new methods

* RegisterCustomBinder
* RegisterCustomConstraint
* NewCtxFunc

#### removed methods

* Mount -> Use app.Use() instead
* ListenTLS -> Use app.Listen() with tls.Config
* ListenTLSWithCertificate -> Use app.Listen() with tls.Config
* ListenMutualTLS -> Use app.Listen() with tls.Config
* ListenMutualTLSWithCertificate -> Use app.Listen() with tls.Config

#### changed methods

* Routing methods -> Get(), Post(), Put(), Delete(), Patch(), Options(), Trace(), Connect() and All()
* Use -> can be used for app mounting
* Test -> timeout changed to 1 second
* Listen -> has a config parameter
* Listener -> has a config parameter

### Context change
#### interface 
#### customizable

#### new methods

* AutoFormat -> ExpressJs like
* Host -> ExpressJs like
* Port -> ExpressJs like
* IsProxyTrusted
* Reset
* Schema -> ExpressJs like
* SendStream -> ExpressJs like
* SendString -> ExpressJs like
* String -> ExpressJs like
* ViewBind -> instead of Bind

#### removed methods

* AllParams -> c.Bind().URL() ?
* ParamsInt -> Params Generic
* QueryBool -> Query Generic
* QueryFloat -> Query Generic
* QueryInt -> Query Generic
* BodyParser -> c.Bind().Body()
* CookieParser -> c.Bind().Cookie()
* ParamsParser -> c.Bind().URL()
* RedirectToRoute -> c.Redirect().Route()
* RedirectBack -> c.Redirect().Back()
* ReqHeaderParser -> c.Bind().Header()

#### changed methods

* Bind -> for Binding instead of View, us c.ViewBind()
* Format -> Param: body interface{} -> handlers ...ResFmt
* Redirect -> c.Redirect().To()

### Client package


### Binding
### Generic functions

### Middleware refactoring

### Updates to CORS Middleware

We've made some changes to the CORS middleware to improve its functionality and flexibility. Here's what's new:

#### New Struct Fields
- `Config.AllowPrivateNetwork`: This new field is a boolean that allows you to control whether private networks are allowed. This is related to the [Private Network Access (PNA)](https://wicg.github.io/private-network-access/) specification from the Web Incubator Community Group (WICG). When set to `true`, the CORS middleware will allow CORS preflight requests from private networks and respond with the `Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network: true` header. This could be useful in development environments or specific use cases, but should be done with caution due to potential security risks.

#### Updated Struct Fields
We've updated several fields from a single string (containing comma-separated values) to slices, allowing for more explicit declaration of multiple values. Here are the updated fields:

- `Config.AllowOrigins`: Now accepts a slice of strings, each representing an allowed origin.
- `Config.AllowMethods`: Now accepts a slice of strings, each representing an allowed method.
- `Config.AllowHeaders`: Now accepts a slice of strings, each representing an allowed header.
- `Config.ExposeHeaders`: Now accepts a slice of strings, each representing an exposed header.

#### Session middleware
#### Filesystem middleware
### Monitor middleware

Monitor middleware is now in Contrib package.

## Migration guide

### CORS Middleware

The CORS middleware has been updated to use slices instead of strings for the `AllowOrigins`, `AllowMethods`, `AllowHeaders`, and `ExposeHeaders` fields. Here's how you can update your code:

```go
// Before
app.Use(cors.New(cors.Config{
  AllowOrigins: "https://example.com,https://example2.com",
  AllowMethods: strings.Join([]string{fiber.MethodGet, fiber.MethodPost}, ","),
  AllowHeaders: "Content-Type",
  ExposeHeaders: "Content-Length",
}))

// After
app.Use(cors.New(cors.Config{
  AllowOrigins: []string{"https://example.com", "https://example2.com"},
  AllowMethods: []string{fiber.MethodGet, fiber.MethodPost},
  AllowHeaders: []string{"Content-Type"},
  ExposeHeaders: []string{"Content-Length"},
}))
```
...
