## TechEmpower

[TechEmpower](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r23) provides a performance comparison of many web application frameworks executing fundamental tasks such as JSON serialization, database access, and server-side template composition.

Each framework is operating in a realistic production configuration. Results are captured on cloud instances and on physical hardware. The test implementations are largely community-contributed and all source is available at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks).

* Fiber `v2.52.5`
* 56 Cores Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6330 CPU @ 2.00GHz (Three homogeneous ProLiant DL360 Gen10 Plus)
* 64GB RAM
* Enterprise SSD
* Ubuntu
* Mellanox Technologies MT28908 Family ConnectX-6 40Gbps Ethernet

### Plaintext

The Plaintext test is an exercise of the request-routing fundamentals only, designed to demonstrate the capacity of high-performance platforms in particular. Requests will be sent using HTTP pipelining. The response payload is still small, meaning good performance is still necessary in order to saturate the gigabit Ethernet of the test environment.

See [Plaintext requirements](https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/wiki/Project-Information-Framework-Tests-Overview#single-database-query)

**Fiber** - **13,509,592** responses per second with an average latency of **0.9** ms.  
**Express** - **279,922** responses per second with an average latency of **551.3** ms.
